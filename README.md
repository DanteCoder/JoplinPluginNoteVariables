# Note Variables Plugin
With this plugin you can create string variables that can be used across all your notes.
If you use a lot the same text on different notes, this plugin could help you save time typing or remembering something.

## Usage
Click on the "x<sup>1</sup>" button on the editor toolbar to add, delete or update your variables.
You can also add, remove or edit your variables directly from the note "%NoteVariables%" that will be created automatically. The note its written in JSON format. You can add variables inside or outside the "vars" property, and then click on the icon right next to the "x<sup>1</sup>" icon. The plugin will automatically put the variables where they belong in the note.

After you defined your variables, you can use them on your notes using the default "%" delimiter for your variables. You can change this on the plugin settings.
